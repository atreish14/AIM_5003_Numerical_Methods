The satellites contain highly accurate atomic clocks and broadcast their position and the time according to their clock. The receiver also contains a (normal) clock and compares its time to the received times to get the travel time of the radio waves from each satellite.\n","\n","Using at least three satellites the receiver is thus able to triangulate its own position _(x,y,z)_. The clock on the receiver is not atomic however and is thus less accurate than the satellite clocks, leading to the necessity of an additional factor, the time drift _d_. A fourth satellite is required to solve for receiver drift in addition to receiver position."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GHMpdERQPm-c"},"source":["# Methodology:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Kwo50W1SPm-d"},"source":["#### Part 1:\n","The method we use for having our receiver determine its own position and drift _(x,y,z,d)_ is the Multivariate Newton method, given 4 satellites' positions and signal travel times as inputs.
